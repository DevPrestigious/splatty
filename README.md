Splat is the sound a tomato makes when it drops. Splatty is your companion as you make the pomdoro timer drop. 

The pomdoro techqnique was invented by Italian student Francesco Cirillo in the late 80's. 
The rules are simple;
1. Get a to-do list and a timer.

2. Set your timer for 25 minutes, and focus on a single task until the timer rings.

3. When your session ends, mark off one pomodoro and record what you completed.

4. Then enjoy a five-minute break.

5. After four pomodoros, take a longer, more restorative 15-30 minute break.

This is a build of the pomdoro technique using react and ionicframework to (hopefully) quickly build a functional app across 3 different platforms.
Web, iOS, Android

I hope you enjoy! üçÖ
